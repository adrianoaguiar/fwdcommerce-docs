# Introduction

Forward is a free and open source e-commerce platform that makes custom development easy.

## Architecture

Initially written in PHP, based on a lightweight MVC framework with a REST-like API. A long-term goal of the project is to standardize conventions and port the API across various programming languages such as JavaScript, Ruby, and Python.
	
## Features

Forward provides a feature-rich e-commerce API that does most of what you need out of the box, including orders, carts, accounts, discounts, products, categories, payments, shipments, emails, and content management.

Most end-user features are meant to be implemented through custom templates and plugins. 

Even the Admin is a template, designed to be customized, extended, tweaked, even replaced if necessary, by anyone with intermediate knowledge of HTML and CSS.
