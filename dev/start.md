## Create

The easiest way to start is by studying and modifying an existing template.

Forward provides two templates out of the box:

* **Admin** &mdash; found in <code>app/templates/admin/</code>
* **Alpha** &mdash;  found in <code>app/templates/alpha/</code>

In addition, a set of e-mail templates can be found in <code>app/templates/emails/</code>. Read more about how templates work in the <a href="template">Template Guide</a>.

## Get Help

Community support is your first line of defense:

* <a href="/alpha/forums">Community Forums</a>
* <a href="/alpha/chat">Open Chat</a>

Professional developer support is also available by <a href="/alpha/download">subscription</a>. For developers with deadlines, this kind of support may save precious time.

### Contributing

The best way to contribute at this early stage is by participating in forum discussion, writing plugins, templates, and by sharing code with other developers.

The Git repository will be private initially, and opened for pull requests soon. If you'd like to contribute to the code and/or documentation, email us at <a href="mailto:contribute@getfwd.com">contribute@getfwd.com</a> and we'll give you early access to it. Please be aware that we may not be able to attend to all code contributions, but your support and ideas are always greatly appreciated.
